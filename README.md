The primary objectives of the Home Security Automation System are as
follows:
● Enhanced Security: The system aims to enhance the security of the home by detecting and alerting homeowners to potential security breaches such as unauthorized access and intrusion.

● Fire and Hazard Detection: The system provides early detection of
fires and hazardous gases, ensuring the safety of the occupants by
triggering alarms and taking immediate action.

● Automation: Automation of security and safety features, such as
turning on lights in response to motion or securing the premises in
the event of an intrusion.

● Remote Monitoring: Allow homeowners to remotely monitor their
home's security and receive real-time alerts on their smartphones
or computers.
